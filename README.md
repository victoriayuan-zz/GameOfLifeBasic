# GameOfLifeBasic
A basic simulation of Conway's Game of Life

This project was created in 2014 in order to visually simulate Conway's famous Game of Life. The simulation is equipped with "Eradicate" and "Populate" buttons which work with the cursor. Simply drag the cursor into a rectangle and press either button to apply the operations to the area selected. In addition, the "Save" and "Load" buttons allow for a user to continue a simulation where they left off last time.
